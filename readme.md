## Todo List Dapp :-

### Intoduction :-
This is a Todo list that is powered by  ethereum smart contract, in which we'll be creating
a smart contract using solidity programming language and then we will write tests against 
the smart contract and deploy it to the blockchain. At last we will be creating a client side for the application.


To access the blockchain todo list, we'll use a web browser to talk to the client side application,
which will be written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Instead of talking to a back end web server
, the client side application will talk directly to the blockchain. Source: dapp university.

### So, what basically is a blockchain? It simply is a database that stores the record of data that has ever taken place
and this record is distributed to all the nodes on the peer-to-peer network.

What is going to be the use of smart contract in this Todo List dapp ?
It will be responsible for fetching all of the tasks in our todo list from the blockchain
, adding new tasks, and completing tasks.

### So what is the working mechanism of the blockchain Todo list dapp:-

We will be creating a client side application of the Todo List that will be directly interacting with the blockchain.
The blockchain which we will be using here will be ethereum blockchain, which we will be accessing by connecting to a 
single ethereum node, then writing a smart contract in solidity that powers the Todo List and then deploying it to the
ethereum blockchain. We will also be connecting to the blockchain network with our personal account using a common ether
-eum wallet for the sake of interacting with our Todo List.

As I am learning development now so for this reason I will be using ganache blockchain that will mimic the behaviour of a 
public blockchain allowing us to deploy smart contracts, develop applications and run tests

benefit-(here the benefit is that you will be getting 10 accounts and in each account you will be provided with 100 ether)

We will have to install truffle which provides us with a suite of tools for developing ethereum smart contracts with 
solidity programming language.

### So what are the key factors of using truffle:-
+ Client side development
+ Script runner
- Development Console
- Network Management
- Deployment &Migrations
- Automated testing
- Smart contract Management

Now, For connecting to the blockchain network we will have to install metamask that is a browser extension
as Most Major web browsers are right now not capable of directly connecting to the blockchain network.
It will help us manange our transactions in ether.
